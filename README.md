<h1>Compose For On-The-Fly Image Building and Multi-Container Testing</h1>
<br>

Goal: This time imagine you're just wanting to learn Drupal's admin and GUI, or maybe you're a software tester and you need to test a new theme for Drupal. When configured properly, this will let you build a custom image and start everything with `docker-compose up` including storing important db and config data in volumes so the site will remember your changes across Compose restarts.
